# Deep_learning_Video_Summary_Activity
ðŸŽ¥ Deep Learning for Video Summarization
This repository contains a deep learning-based approach to automatic video summarization. The goal is to generate concise and informative summaries from long videos using BART and Transformers.

ðŸ§  Project Overview
Video summarization aims to reduce the length of a video while preserving its essential content. This project applies deep learning models to extract the most important frames or shots, providing a meaningful summary for efficient viewing.
